# Horiseon Homework
By Jake Smith

## Description

This repository was created as a school project, as a way of practicing increasing availability and searchability on the internet. Given starter files for containing relevent CSS and HTML,
I mainly had to add alt tags to pictures, in order to help those with visual impairments interact with the webpage. I also changed many precoded 'div' tags into more descriptive semantic 
tags, which will help people find this webpage quicker. All of this was accomplished through the use of CSS, HTML, Chrome's devtools, and stored in github.com.
